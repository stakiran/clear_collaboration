## What is Clear Collaboration
It is an asynchronous collaboration method, and "clear" means both "make explicit" and "resolve." The premise is that by reading and writing asynchronously, you make context and opinions explicit; once they are explicit, the path to resolution—how to make decisions—should naturally come into view.

In Clear Collaboration, you go as far as **having all the information and decisions needed to actually take action**. This is about the preparation and consideration phase before you move into full execution. This is described as creating a **booster**.
Think of it as producing the fuel that will accelerate later actions.

All interactions in Clear Collaboration are **fully asynchronous**. In other words, spoken conversation such as meetings cannot occur. This is intentional, based on the premise that clearing things requires putting them into words and presenting them.

In Clear Collaboration, reading and writing are done in units called topics. One topic represents one subject, and you may end up creating dozens, hundreds, or in some cases thousands of topics. Topics can also be connected with links, so the whole becomes a network structure. This practice is called **topic-oriented**.

Summary:

- Clear Collaboration is a collaboration method for clearing things up
- "Clear" includes two meanings: "make explicit" and "resolve." By making things explicit through linguistic reading and writing, you expect that resolution (the right way to make decisions to get closer to resolution) will naturally come into view
- Core ideas:
    - Interact fully asynchronously
    - Go as far as assembling the booster (the information and decisions needed for later action)
    - Build in a topic-oriented way, with one subject per topic

## Topic-oriented
A topic has Talk, Target, and Task. You start by creating it as Talk, and it gets promoted from Talk → Target → Task.

A topic includes one title (topic name) and one body:

- The title indicates the essence of the topic, and it can be a sentence. For example, if you are considering three options A, B, and C, it's fine to have topics like "Option C is out of the question" or "Option C cannibalizes our ~~." Rather, it's better if **it's clear what it means just by looking at the title**
- The body is multi-line text, but it doesn't need to be structured enough to introduce a heading hierarchy. Also, since multiple people will edit simultaneously, it will likely be a SaaS note or wiki, and therefore the text will probably be rich text

Topics can, and should, be connected with links. This is because you want to operate the whole as a network structure. Note that this is not a hierarchical structure like folders. Therefore, the tool you use will likely be something like a note app or wiki that supports linking and makes it easy to create links.

Next, the 3T:

- **Talk** is, as the name suggests, vague conversation—if you think in terms of divergence and convergence, it corresponds to the divergence phase. Anything goes: casual chat, lining up gathered information, creating a daily page (create a page for the day where everyone gathers and posts short notes), etc.
- **Target** is a promoted Talk. A Talk becomes a Target when an **owner** emerges. There is only one owner per topic, and that person leads the topic. The owner handles everything: how to proceed, how to examine, decision-making, etc. Everyone else becomes an advisor. Advisors have no decision rights; how to run the Target topic and how to reach a conclusion is decided by the owner
    - You should explicitly write down who the owner is
    - You are free to change the owner. If the people involved agree, that's sufficient
    - If you don't like a Target topic, you can fork it—i.e., duplicate it and proceed with yourself as the owner. For that reason, multiple Target topics often proceed in parallel for different people
- **Task** is a promoted Target. While working through a Target, a situation may arise where "you can't obtain the information you need and the examination can't proceed unless you take concrete action." This concrete action is called a task. A Target topic in which tasks arise becomes a Task topic. A Task topic has a task list, and for each task you assign an **assignee**. You don't manage progress, but instead the owner becomes a **reminder** who can nudge assignees
    - Due to the No ABCD principle described later, Clear Collaboration normally doesn't involve management or constraints. However, nudging within a Task topic is the exception

## The goal of Clear Collaboration
To assemble the booster.

You can treat some subset of topics as the booster, and finish when you feel the booster is complete. For example, if you have 600 topics and you treat 20 of them as the booster, then those 20 are the deliverables of Clear Collaboration.

## Principles of Clear Collaboration
All three of these principles must be satisfied.

### 1: Topic-oriented
As described above.

### 2: No ABCD
Clear Collaboration should be advanced exploratorily by each individual, without any management or constraints. This principle is represented by No ABCD, which is an abbreviation of the following:

- No Assign. Don't assign
- No Ball. Don't hold the ball, and don't make others hold it
- No Consensus. Don't seek consensus (everyone should just write freely)
- No Deadline. Don't set deadlines

Therefore, there is no progress management, no planning, and no meetings at all.

### 3: Writing Stack
**Writing Stack** means that the source of truth for information exists not in people's heads but in the system. In Clear Collaboration, that is, of course, the topics.

In other words, you must not keep it in your head; you must put it out as a topic. Clear Collaboration is done by an individual or a small group, and you deepen your thinking while reading what members write. Also, as per No ABCD, you don't explicitly constrain people and convey things through meetings or conversations. Writing things down is the most important part.

## Operational guidelines for Clear Collaboration
They are called "guidelines," and you don't necessarily have to follow them. However, the more you deviate from them, the harder it becomes for Clear Collaboration to work.

- You should tackle exploratory themes where you still won't have an answer even after thinking, examining, experimenting, and discussing for several months
- You should do it solo or in a small group of 4 or fewer people
- Every member should be able to focus for 2 hours a day without being disturbed by anyone
- Every member should be accustomed to reading and writing enough to write several thousand characters per day and read tens of thousands of characters per day
- Every member should secure ongoing resources so they can keep reading and writing every day
- As the tool, you should use Cosense, or an equivalent-or-better wiki or note app that supports simultaneous editing, runs lightly, and makes it easy to create pages and links between pages

## Clear Collaboration TIPS

### An SSoT, private venue
You should have only one venue for Clear Collaboration. For example, in Cosense, create one Project and have all members read and write there. For Notion, a teamspace—or ideally the workspace—is good.

Next, the venue should be an SSoT—a single source of truth you can rely on. In other words, during Clear Collaboration, you should be able to get everything you need just by looking at that place. External information should be shared only by writing the URL. A common anti-pattern is to make cloud storage like Dropbox or Box, or even a VCS like GitHub, part of the venue as well—this is a yellow flag. The venue must be a single, simultaneously editable, text-based workspace.

And the venue should be limited to members only. Outsiders, including members' managers, must never be allowed in. Also, members should be decided when you start Clear Collaboration, and should not be changed until that Clear Collaboration ends. Clear Collaboration is something where each member writes without holding back, which also includes a great deal of self-disclosure. To ensure psychological safety, this closed nature must be defended at all costs. If you can't do that, you should not do Clear Collaboration.

I'd like to make this a principle, but in practice that's not always possible, so I'm treating it as a tip. Still, as much as possible, I want you to adopt this without fail.

### Flow topics
A flow topic refers to a Talk topic that every member accesses many times a day.

Typically, this is a daily topic created for each date, named with the date. Each member can carve out their own area there and then write a journal. If it takes hold well, it becomes a place everyone visits multiple times a day, creating a culture where simply writing there ensures others will read it and react.

### Summaries and debris
In Clear Collaboration, discussion and deliberation within a single topic can sometimes heat up. The owner understands the details, but it's hard for other members to catch up.

So it's recommended to distinguish between "the current summary" and "everything else (debris)" for outsiders. Outsiders can grasp the outline by looking only at the summary, and can browse the debris as needed. Also, if possible, it's better to leave only the summary in the topic and isolate the debris into a separate topic. Long topic bodies increase cognitive cost by themselves.

For example, if topic T starts to get busy, keep (and update) only the summary part, and move the rest of the debris to another topic T1. As links, connect T → T1 so it's accessible from T. Also, when you want to refer to T, you can link to T and ignore T1. T1 is debris of T, and it should have no links from anywhere other than T.

By keeping this summaries-and-debris practice in mind, members can write freely in topics without hesitation. The important point is to **allow writing personal debris**, but if you only allow it, it becomes noise—so you isolate it as debris. You need both: allowance and isolation.

A common anti-pattern is being **knowledge-oriented**, which is the idea that you should write only knowledge that is useful to everyone. But being knowledge-oriented hinders Clear Collaboration. It's more productive to think while writing than to write only what you've already thought through; and if you're going to write anyway, it's better to just do it in Clear Collaboration rather than bouncing between your personal notes and the Clear Collaboration venue. This seamlessness is extremely important in terms of experience. Knowledge-orientation may feel natural to people familiar with wikis, but in Clear Collaboration it's an anti-pattern—be careful.

### Tomiboma
**Tomiboma** is a nickname meaning "the four horsemen of annoyance," and is an abbreviation of:

- Toil (unavoidable but boring work)
- Mia-shell (things that have become hollow formalities)
- Bottleneck
- Mind cutter (interruptions)

You will probably do Clear Collaboration as part of work, and if it's work, it will inevitably include many "social problems" of teams and organizations. In other words, there will be inconvenient constraints, and fuzzy frustration or impatience you can't even put into words.

If you leave those alone, Clear Collaboration won't go well. Rather, it's good to address them proactively, also as a warm-up. You thoroughly examine what Tomiboma exist, each one's context and issues, and how to avoid or resolve them.

When thinking about Tomiboma, you will likely think about Tomiboma related to yourself or your surroundings. In other words, you'll think as a party involved, and you should be able to think with high resolution. Along the way, you can gain various learnings and insights, and they will also be useful in pursuing the goal of Clear Collaboration.

### Report topics
When you do "serious input" such as attending an event or reading materials closely, create a topic about it and write the source, context, and your impressions. This is called a report topic. The topic name can simply be the event or material name so it's easy to refer to.

This lets all members access and refer to the topic by event/material name, sparking inspiration and energizing discussion.

### Decision-maker
The roles defined by Clear Collaboration are only "owner" and "assignee," but it's also good to decide on a **decision-maker**.

A decision-maker is something you set for the venue: someone with decision authority, like a team's manager. Realistically, many organizations have a "small number of people, or a single person" with decision authority, and this is meant to reflect that.

The decision-maker must make decisions when decisions are required within topics. Of course, since this is a world of reading and writing, they must actually write the decision. Gathering everyone in a meeting to talk while looking at faces is unnecessary, and anyone who insists on doing that doesn't fit Clear Collaboration and should be expelled.

If the person who would be the decision-maker is not suitable as a member, then you should designate someone who relays to that person as the decision-maker. The relay person communicates as needed with the "person who corresponds to the decision-maker" outside of Clear Collaboration, brings the results into the venue, and reflects them. Due to this nature, the relay person can't immerse themselves in the activity as much as other members, and relaying becomes their main mission. Of course, this approach is not desirable. As much as possible, the decision-maker themselves should also be a member, and if that's not possible, it's better to set the theme so that you can do Clear Collaboration within a scope that doesn't require a decision-maker.

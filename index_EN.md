## What is Clear Collaboration
It is an asynchronous collaboration method, and "clear" refers to both "make things explicit" and "resolve." The approach is based on the premise that by reading and writing asynchronously, you make context and opinions explicit; once things are explicit, the way to resolve them -- including how to make decisions -- should naturally come into view.

In Clear Collaboration, you go as far as **assembling the information and decisions necessary to actually take action**. This is about the preparation and consideration phase before you move into full-scale execution. This is described as creating a **booster**. Think of it as producing the fuel that will accelerate later action.

All exchanges in Clear Collaboration are **conducted entirely asynchronously**. In other words, no spoken conversations, including meetings, can occur. This is intentional, based on the premise that to make things clear, you need articulation in language and its presentation.

In Clear Collaboration, reading and writing are done in units called topics. One subject is expressed as one topic, and you will end up creating dozens, hundreds, or sometimes thousands of topics. Topics can also be connected by relationships, forming an overall network structure. This practice is called **topic-oriented**.

Summary:

- Clear Collaboration is a collaboration method for making things clear
- "Clear" includes two meanings, "make explicit" and "resolve"; by making things explicit through linguistic reading and writing, you expect that resolution (the right balance in decision-making to move toward it) will naturally become visible
- Core ideas:
    - Conduct all exchanges entirely asynchronously
    - Go as far as assembling the booster (the information and decisions needed for later action)
    - Build based on a topic-oriented approach: one subject, one topic

## Topic-oriented
Topics come in Talk, Target, and Task. You first create them as Talk, and they are promoted from Talk → Target → Task.

A topic contains one title (topic name) and one body:

- The title indicates the essence of the topic and may be a full sentence. For example, if you considered three options A, B, and C, you could have topics like "Option C is out of the question" or "Option C cannibalizes our ____." Rather, it's better if **you can tell what it indicates just by looking at the title**
- The body is multi-line text, but it doesn't have to be structured enough to introduce a heading hierarchy. Also, since multiple people edit simultaneously, it will likely be a SaaS note or wiki, and thus the text will probably be rich text

Topics can, and should, be connected with links. This is because you want to operate the whole as a network structure. Note that this is not a hierarchical structure like folders. Therefore, the tool you use will likely be something like a note app or wiki that has linking features and makes it easy to add links.

Next, the 3T:

- **Talk**, as the name suggests, means a vague conversation; in terms of divergence/convergence, it corresponds to the divergence phase. Anything goes: casual chat, listing collected information, creating a daily page (make a page for the day where everyone gathers and each person posts), etc.
- **Target** is an upgraded Talk. A Talk becomes a Target when an **owner** emerges. There is only one owner per topic, and that person leads the topic. The owner handles everything: how to proceed, how to consider, decision-making, etc., and everyone else becomes an advisor. Advisors have no decision rights; how to operate the Target topic and how to reach a conclusion are decided by the owner
    - You should explicitly write who the owner is
    - You may change the owner freely; it's fine as long as the people involved agree
    - If you don't like a Target topic, you can fork it -- that is, duplicate it and proceed with yourself as the owner. For this reason, Target topics often proceed in parallel for multiple people
- **Task** is an upgraded Target. Along the way in a Target, a situation can arise where "you can't obtain information or move consideration forward without taking concrete action." This concrete action is called a task. A Target topic in which tasks arise becomes a Task topic. A Task topic has a task list, and you assign an **assignee** to each task. You do not do progress management; instead, the owner becomes a **reminder** and can nudge assignees
    - Due to the No ABCD principle described later, Clear Collaboration normally does not involve management or control. However, nudging within a Task topic is the exception

## The goal of Clear Collaboration
To assemble the booster.

You can treat some of the topics as boosters, and end when you feel the boosters are all in place. For example, if there are 600 topics and you regard 20 of them as boosters, then those 20 are the deliverables of Clear Collaboration.

## Principles of Clear Collaboration
All three principles must be satisfied.

### 1: Topic-oriented
As described above.

### 2: No ABCD
Clear Collaboration should be advanced exploratorily by each person, without any management or control. The principle that expresses this is No ABCD, an abbreviation of the following:

- No Assign: Don't assign
- No Ball: Don't hold the ball, and don't make others hold it
- No Consensus: Don't seek consensus (everyone should write freely)
- No Deadline: Don't set deadlines

Therefore, there is no progress management, planning, or meetings at all.

### 3: Writing Stack
**Writing Stack** means that the source of truth for information exists not in people's heads but in the system. In Clear Collaboration, of course, that system is the topics.

In other words, you must not keep things in your head; you must always put them out as topics. Clear Collaboration is done by an individual or a small group, but as you read what other members write, you will deepen your thinking further. Also, as per No ABCD, you will not explicitly bind and convey things through meetings or conversations. Writing things down is the most important.

## Operational guidelines for Clear Collaboration
They are called principles, but you don't necessarily have to follow them. However, the further you deviate from them, the harder it becomes for Clear Collaboration to hold.

- You should work on exploratory themes where no answer emerges even after months of thinking, consideration, experimentation, and discussion
- You should do it alone or with a small group of 4 people or fewer
- All members should be able to concentrate for 2 hours a day without being disturbed by anyone
- All members should be accustomed to reading and writing to the extent that they can write several thousand characters per day and read tens of thousands of characters per day
- All members should secure resources continuously so that they can read and write every day
- As the tool, you should use Cosense, or a wiki or note app that supports simultaneous editing, runs lightly, and makes page creation and inter-page linking as easy as Cosense or easier
